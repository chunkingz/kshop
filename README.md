# kshop :shopping_cart:

k-Shop is my final year university project, an ecommerce website still under development. 

 <br>

## Stack :hammer_and_wrench:

:point_right: html <br>
:point_right: css <br>
:point_right: jquery <br>
:point_right: php <br>
:point_right: mysql <br>
:point_right: boostrap <br>

Feel free to clone and use or contribute to this work. 

Note that its not 100% complete, some links might be broken as I haven't worked on it since I presented it at my final year defense in the university. 

New modifications/suggestions are welcome. 

:bowtie: Cheers...
